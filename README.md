# The Not So Final Frontier in GitHubness
*a space (with no trek) for experimenting with GitHUb as a work space*

![pseudo trek](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Star_Trek_uniforms.jpg "not quite trek")


This would be the place where code and stuff lives. Other parts to be added, linked etc might be:

* A public web site created with a Jekyll type theme
* A [gitter](https://gitter.im/) for chat
* A [waffle](https://waffle.io/) for public status of project work
* A [huboard](https://huboard.com/) or maybe a [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) for project managament
* Some Slack/Rocketchat integration
* And always, some [puppies](http://openpuppies.com)
